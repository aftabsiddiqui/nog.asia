Here are the steps to create a Network Operator Group (NOG). It's important to note that these steps do not have to be followed in a specific sequence; they can be executed simultaneously, in reverse, or any order that suits the situation. This framework is intended to provide a general guideline, derived from multiple conversations with individuals who have firsthand experience in establishing NOGs.

**Step 0**: Identify Enthusiastic Individuals: Begin by identifying a small group of individuals who are passionate about networking and willing to initiate the process of establishing a NOG. These individuals will serve as the foundation and driving force behind the NOG's formation, bringing together like-minded professionals and kick-starting the process of planning and organizing. Seek help from someone who has done this before, neighboring NOG.

**Step 1**: Research and Planning: Conduct thorough research to understand the need and potential for establishing a NOG in your country. First thing you need to answer, why do you need a NOG? Is there anything similar to NOG already working in the country? What do you want to achieve from this group?

**Step 2**: Formation of Steering Committee: Form a steering committee comprising representatives from different network operators, ISPs, universities, and relevant organizations. This committee will be responsible for driving the establishment of the NOG. 

**Step 3**: Define Objectives and Scope: Clearly define the objectives and scope of the NOG, including its mission, goals, target audience, and areas of focus (e.g., technical discussions, knowledge sharing, capacity building, policy advocacy). You must have got some good answers from Step 1, use them wisely here.

**Step 4**: Engage Stakeholders: Reach out to stakeholders and potential members to gauge interest and gather input on the proposed NOG. Hold meetings over drinks or just virtual meet-ups to discuss the benefits and goals of the NOG and solicit feedback. Here you are trying to cement the idea which you established in Step 3. A lot of jumping between Step 2 - Step 4 will happen at this stage.

**Step 5**: Develop Governance Structure: Develop a governance structure for the NOG, including roles and responsibilities, membership criteria, decision-making processes, and code of conduct. Consider adopting bylaws or a charter to formalize the organization's structure. This step is not forcing you to register the entity in your country or get legal status of any kind but for any group or organisation to work smoothly, it require governance structure. 

**Step 6**: Select Leadership: Elect or appoint leadership positions, such as a chairperson, vice-chairperson, secretary, treasurer and industry liaison, to oversee the NOG's activities and operations. Remember for effective functioning, every group or organization necessitates a governance framework.

**Step 7**: Establish Communication Channels: Set up communication channels, such as a website, mailing list, social media accounts, to facilitate interaction and information sharing among NOG members and general community.

**Step 8**: Plan Inaugural Event: Organize an inaugural event or meeting to officially launch the NOG and introduce its objectives, leadership, and activities to the community. Invite key stakeholders, guest speakers, and representatives from other NOGs or regional organizations. Not necessarily an extravagant event, again, it's simply a casual gathering, perhaps post-office hours, in a shared office or coworking space. Keep in mind, the objective is to foster a community, not to boast about the scale of the event.

**Step 9**: Develop Work Plan and Activities: Develop a work plan outlining the NOG's activities, including regular meetings, technical workshops, training sessions, collaborative projects, and participation in regional or international NOG events.

**Step 10**: Promote Collaboration and Participation: Foster collaboration and active participation among NOG members by organizing regular meetings, sharing technical knowledge and best practices, facilitating peer-to-peer networking, and encouraging contributions to the NOG's initiatives.
